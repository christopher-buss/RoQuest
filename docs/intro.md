RobloxStateMachine is a lightweight library that simplifies the creation and management of state machines. It allows you create States and Transitions which are reusable and can contain/interact with different data.

See the [Getting Started](gettingStarted) to jump into it!

## 🔍Why Choose RobloxStateMachine

### 🏗️Structure
RSM breaks down the complete logic of an AI into multiple fractions or files. This allows for developers to isolate their code and only work on one logic at a time making it easier to navigate thru large code bases without losing track of their work!

### 🔌Extensible
With this library it's very easy to add more states and transitions as your project evolves without the need to understand/go thru existing code.

### 🔧🧹Maintenance
This library is heavily maintained and will continue to be for a very long time! If any bug ever gets found or feature is requested it will be updated as soon as possible.

### 🗡️Battle-Scarred
This library has already been battle-scarred. It was used in many projects many of them amounting many million visits and never broke or had any bug at all.
