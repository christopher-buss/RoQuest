# 🤔About

RoQuest is a sophisticated abstract implementation of a Quest System. Although it can self manage nearly everything by itself it also allows for the developer to manually set and manage everything making it capable of adapting to your needs!


## 🔍Why RoQuest

One of the most common yet most challenging systems that games require are quest systems. These systems should be capable of containing, tracking and reacting to progress of the player during his playtime.

Since this is such a heavy system and that should be avoided to be hardcoded I decided to make an abstract one that would allow me to easily add quest systems to all my projects. I then decided to open-source it to contribute to the community and possibly have the help of other developers in order to improve this system even further!
