/**
 * This is the main class of our quest system. Quest objects define exactly the
 * kind of quest and how can a player complete it. When declaring a quest there
 * are multiple properties that should be taken into consideration. On the
 * following example we can see how could we, per example, make a quest to
 * collect 5 apples.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const appleQuest = new ObjectiveInfo({
 * 	ObjectiveId: "CollectApples",
 * 	Name: "Collect Apples",
 * 	Description: "Collect %s apples",
 * });
 *
 * const quest = new Quest({
 * 	Name: "Collect Apples",
 * 	Description: "Collect %s apples",
 * 	QuestId: "AppleCollection",
 * 	QuestAcceptType: QuestAcceptType.Automatic,
 * 	QuestDeliverType: QuestDeliverType.Automatic,
 * 	QuestRepeatableType: QuestRepeatableType.NonRepeatable,
 * 	QuestStart: 0,
 * 	QuestEnd: 0,
 * 	RequiredQuests: [],
 * 	LifeCycles: ["AppleQuest"],
 * 	QuestObjectives: [appleQuest.NewObjective(5)],
 * });
 * ```
